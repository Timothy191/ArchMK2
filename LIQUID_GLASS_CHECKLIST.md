# Liquid Glass Interface – Phased Implementation Checklist

> **Goal**: Transform a standard login UI into a fluid, dynamic **Liquid Glass** experience using glassmorphism, organic shapes, WebGL shaders, and polished highlights.  
> Use `[x]` to mark a task complete.

---

## Global Requirements & Prerequisites

- [x] Modern browser support (Chrome, Edge, Firefox – backdrop-filter + WebGL)
- [x] Access to the target desktop background image (for refraction)
- [x] Dev environment with live reload
- [x] Basic Three.js / GLSL familiarity (for Phase 3)
- [x] Permission to use WebGL canvas behind the login card
- [x] Accessibility baseline: high-contrast text inside glass elements

---

## Phase 1 – Foundations & Static Glassmorphism

_Primary goal: Establish the frosty glass look with standard CSS._

### 1.1 Structure

- [x] Write clean HTML5 semantic container for the login card
- [x] Isolate the backdrop context so blur won’t bleed into other UI

### 1.2 Core Glass Styles

- [x] Apply `backdrop-filter: blur(20px) saturate(140%);` to the card
- [x] Set background to `rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.15)` (or dark variant)
- [x] Add a subtle gradient border:  
      `border: 1px solid rgba(255,255,255,0.3);`

### Secondary Polish (Phase 1)

- [x] Adjust blur radius for different viewport sizes (responsive)
- [x] Test on top of light/dark backgrounds for contrast
- [x] Ensure text remains sharp (no backdrop-filter on text elements)

### Phase 1 Requirements

- [x] CSS Custom Properties (variables) for easy tuning
- [x] No JavaScript needed yet

---

## Phase 2 – Fluid Contours & Organic Geometry

_Primary goal: Break rigid box shapes and add liquid-like micro-interactions._

### 2.1 Organic Shapes

- [x] Replace uniform border-radius with irregular, “blobby” values  
      Example: `border-radius: 40% 60% 60% 40% / 50% 30% 70% 50%;`
- [x] Apply similar organic shapes to input fields and button

### 2.2 Hover & Focus Micro-Interactions

- [x] Add smooth `transition` on transform / border-radius (200–400ms ease-out)
- [x] Implement “squish” effect on hover: scale slightly and morph radius
- [x] Layer internal specular highlights with `box-shadow`:
  ```css
  box-shadow:
    inset 0 8px 16px rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.4),
    inset 0 -8px 16px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.05),
    0 12px 24px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);
  ```

### Secondary Enhancements (Phase 2)

- [x] Animate border gradient rotation for a glossy “light sweep”
- [x] Add subtle `drop-shadow` to the card for depth
- [x] Experiment with `clip-path` for more organic edges (optional)

### Phase 2 Requirements

- [x] CSS transitions / animations enabled
- [x] No layout shift when morphing (use `will-change` sparingly)

---

## Phase 3 – Advanced Refraction & Shaders (The “Liquid” Core)

_Primary goal: Realistic background warping through the glass using WebGL._

### 3.1 Canvas Setup

- [x] Place a full‑size `<canvas>` behind the login card (z-index below card)
- [x] Initialize Three.js or raw WebGL context
- [x] Load the desktop background as a texture (or capture screen)

### 3.2 Refraction Shader (GLSL)

- [x] Write a fragment shader that samples the background texture
- [x] Distort UV coordinates using a dynamic normal map (ripple/melt)
- [x] Simulate caustics: bright spots where light concentrates
- [x] Drive distortion via mouse position (mapped to card coordinates)
- [x] Add a slow ambient time loop for idle movement

### 3.3 Integration with CSS Glass

- [x] Ensure canvas matches card dimensions and position (`getBoundingClientRect`)
- [x] Mask canvas to the card’s visible area (so only the card shows distortion)
- [x] Keep CSS backdrop-filter as a fallback for non‑WebGL browsers

### Secondary Tasks (Phase 3)

- [x] Create a subtle displacement texture for the liquid surface
- [x] Add an optional “drip” effect when the card first appears
- [x] Performance: throttle shader updates, respect `requestAnimationFrame`

### Phase 3 Requirements

- [x] WebGL‑enabled browser (or graceful degradation to static glass)
- [x] High‑resolution background image (≥1920px)
- [x] Knowledge of GLSL or ability to adapt open‑source shaders

---

## Phase 4 – Textures, Highlights & Refinement

_Primary goal: Add the microscopic details that sell realism._

### 4.1 Surface Gloss & Light Sources

- [x] Overlay a glossy SVG gradient (light streak) in the top‑left area
- [x] Add an animated noise/ grain texture with `mix-blend-mode: overlay`
- [x] Fine‑tune opacity and blending so the surface feels tangible

### 4.2 Text & Icon Readability

- [x] Apply high‑contrast text color (e.g., `#fff` or `#000` at 90% opacity)
- [x] Add `text-shadow` to lift text from the distorted background
- [x] Check icons/buttons remain clearly visible under all distortion states

### 4.3 Accessibility & Responsiveness

- [x] Test with keyboard navigation (focus states must be obvious)
- [x] Ensure form labels are readable despite glass effects
- [x] Provide a reduced‑motion fallback (disable animations for users who prefer)
- [x] Scale gracefully on mobile (consider touch interactions)

### Secondary Polish (Phase 4)

- [x] Add subtle hover‑glow on the sign‑in button
- [x] Include a loading state (e.g., shimmer while shader initialises)
- [x] Create a dark‑mode variant of the glass effect

### Phase 4 Requirements

- [x] CSS Blend Modes support (`mix-blend-mode`)
- [x] SVG assets for highlights (or pure CSS gradients)
- [x] Cross‑browser testing (Safari backdrop-filter quirks)
