- [x] **Vector Dimensions**: Transitioned embeddings in `memories` table from 1536-dim (OpenAI) to 768-dim Nomics vectors (`nomic-embed-text`) via migration 058
- [x] **Embedding Cache**: Added `embedding_cache` database table (user-isolated, text hash-keyed) to store pre-calculated vector embeddings and save local CPU/GPU cycles
- [x] **LLM-Driven Tool Dispatch**: Implemented intelligent tool dispatch in `tool-dispatch.ts` replacing regex keyword matching, evaluating intent with confidence scores 1-5
- [x] **Tool Output Caching**: Added LRU cache in `tool-cache.ts` with 5s TTL to prevent database storming during fast user requests
- [x] **Procedural Memory Removal**: Cleaned up DB schema and code logic (migration 061) to drop the `procedural` memory type, merging its data into semantic memory

### Recommended Next Steps (Post-Phase 5.2)

From `project-comprehensive-report.md` §9 — 5 priority actions:

---

#### 1. 🟢 On-Premises Server Setup & Cockpit `[HIGH]` — 1–2 days

Provision the mining site server and deploy the full stack via `./scripts/deploy.sh local`. The local dev environment is already production-identical and local Ollama is fully wired for offline execution.

- [ ] Provision Linux server (Ubuntu 22.04 / RHEL 9) at mining site
- [ ] Install Cockpit (`port 9090`) for web-based server management
- [ ] Configure Docker Compose with all services
- [ ] Test offline-capable deployment workflow
- [ ] Validate all 8 departments, local AI chat, n8n, Grafana

📖 [[on-premises-deployment|Full guide: On-Premises Deployment & Cockpit]]

---

#### 2. 🟠 Comprehensive Testing & QA `[HIGH]` — 1 week

Raise test coverage from 40%+ → 90%+. Add E2E flows, visual regression, load testing, and security penetration scan.

- [ ] `pnpm test -- --coverage` → identify gaps
- [ ] Add E2E tests: login, department nav, data entry, AI chat, admin panel
- [ ] Visual regression with Storybook + Chromatic
- [ ] Load testing with k6 (50 concurrent users, 5 min)
- [ ] OWASP ZAP security scan against local deployment

📖 [[testing-qa-strategy|Full guide: Testing & QA Strategy]]

---

#### 3. 🟠 Database Optimization & Scaling `[HIGH]` — 3–4 days

Verify PgBouncer and optimize slow queries in production.

- [ ] Add PgBouncer to Docker Compose (transaction mode, 25 pool size)
- [ ] Enable `pg_stat_statements`, identify top-10 slow queries
- [ ] Ensure materialized views are refreshing correctly under pg_cron schedules

📖 [[database-optimization|Full guide: Database Optimization & Scaling]]

---

#### 4. 🟡 Mobile Responsiveness & PWA `[MEDIUM]` — 1 week

Improve mobile layouts for field operators, implement PWA install + offline mode, optimize Control Room for tablets.

- [ ] Responsive audit at 375px / 768px / 1024px breakpoints
- [ ] Create `manifest.json` + service worker via `next-pwa`
- [ ] Implement offline write queue with `localStorage` + `online` event
- [ ] Touch-optimized forms (44px tap targets, native select on mobile)
- [ ] Test on iOS Safari, Chrome Android, iPad landscape

📖 [[mobile-pwa|Full guide: Mobile Responsiveness & PWA]]

---

#### 5. 🟡 Advanced Analytics & Reporting `[MEDIUM]` — 2 weeks

Executive KPI dashboard, PDF/Excel report generation, trend forecasting, data export API, and ML predictive maintenance.

- [ ] Route `/hub/executive` — cross-department KPI dashboard
- [ ] PDF export via `@react-pdf/renderer` + Excel via `xlsx`
- [ ] n8n scheduled workflow: monthly report → email
- [ ] Rolling 7-day averages + linear forecast on production charts

- [ ] ML predictive maintenance model (XGBoost on breakdown history)

📖 [[analytics-reporting|Full guide: Advanced Analytics & Reporting]]

---

### Implementation Timeline

| Week      | Focus                                           |
| --------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Week 1    | On-premises server provisioning & Cockpit setup |
| Week 2    | Test coverage expansion + E2E critical paths    |
| Week 3    | Database optimization & PgBouncer verification  |
| Week 4–5  | Mobile responsiveness + PWA                     |
| Month 2–3 | Executive dashboard + analytics + ML            |

---

## 📋 Known Limitations & Technical Debt

### Intentional Decisions

- **hourly_loads denormalization:** 12 hour columns (intentional for simplicity; partitioned + indexed)
- **Shift notes consolidation:** Moved to operational_delays (working as designed)
- **Limited mobile UI:** Focus on desktop control room; responsive for tablets
- **Light-only theme:** Hardcoded `data-theme="light"` via `<script>` in `<head>`; dark mode does not exist and is not planned

### Resolved Items ✅

- ~~Partitioning for time-series tables~~ → Done (migration 020)
- ~~Materialized views~~ → Done (migration 022)
- ~~pg_cron archival~~ → Done (migrations 023, 033, 046)
- ~~Read replica client~~ → Done (@repo/supabase)
- ~~Admin data API security~~ → Done (migration 043, superadmin lockdown)
- ~~Vulnerability cleanup~~ → Done (migration 057, ignore client role metadata)
- ~~Offline AI execution~~ → Done (local Ollama gemma4 & nomic-embed-text)
- ~~Test runner stabilization~~ → Done (migrated from Turborepo to Nx)

### Remaining Future Work

- **Medium Priority:** E2E test coverage expansion, visual regression suite
- **Medium Priority:** Mobile PWA (offline queue, touch targets, service worker)
- **Low Priority:** Executive KPI dashboard full buildout
- **Low Priority:** ML predictive maintenance model (XGBoost on breakdown history)
