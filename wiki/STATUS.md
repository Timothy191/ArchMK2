- [ ] Migration 017: Partition `hourly_loads` and `daily_logs` by month
- [ ] Migration 018: Partition `machine_hours` and `fuel_logs`
- [ ] Migration 019: Materialized views (dept summary, machine utilization)
- [ ] Add PgBouncer to Docker Compose (transaction mode, 25 pool size)
- [ ] Enable `pg_stat_statements`, identify top-10 slow queries

📖 [[database-optimization|Full guide: Database Optimization & Scaling]]

---

#### 4. 🟡 Mobile Responsiveness & PWA `[MEDIUM]` — 1 week

Improve mobile layouts for field operators, implement PWA install + offline mode, optimize Control Room for tablets.

- [ ] Responsive audit at 375px / 768px / 1024px breakpoints

- [ ] Implement offline write queue with `localStorage` + `online` event
- [ ] Touch-optimized forms (44px tap targets, native select on mobile)
- [ ] Test on iOS Safari, Chrome Android, iPad landscape

📖 [[mobile-pwa|Full guide: Mobile Responsiveness & PWA]]

---

#### 5. 🟡 Advanced Analytics & Reporting `[MEDIUM]` — 2 weeks

Executive KPI dashboard, PDF/Excel report generation, trend forecasting, data export API, and ML predictive maintenance.

- [ ] Route `/hub/executive` — cross-department KPI dashboard
- [ ] PDF export via `@react-pdf/renderer` + Excel via `xlsx`
- [ ] n8n scheduled workflow: monthly report → email
- [ ] Rolling 7-day averages + linear forecast on production charts
- [ ] Data export REST API (`/api/export/production`, `/api/export/machines`)

### Implementation Timeline

| Week      | Focus                                           |
| --------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Week 1    | On-premises server provisioning & Cockpit setup |
| Week 2    | Test coverage expansion + E2E critical paths    |
| Week 3    | Database partitioning + query optimization      |
| Week 4–5  | Mobile responsiveness + PWA                     |
| Month 2–3 | Executive dashboard + analytics + ML            |

---

## 📋 Known Limitations & Technical Debt

### Intentional Decisions

- **hourly_loads denormalization:** 12 hour columns (intentional for simplicity; partitioned + indexed)
- **Shift notes consolidation:** Moved to operational_delays (working as designed)
- **Limited mobile UI:** Focus on desktop control room; responsive for tablets
- **Light-only theme:** Hardcoded `data-theme="light"` via `<script>` in `<head>`; dark mode does not exist and is not planned

### Resolved Post-Phase 3 Items ✅

- ~~Partitioning for time-series tables~~ → Done (migration 020)
- ~~Materialized views~~ → Done (migration 022)
- ~~pg_cron archival~~ → Done (migrations 023, 033, 046)
- ~~Read replica client~~ → Done (@repo/supabase)
- ~~Admin data API security~~ → Done (migration 043, superadmin lockdown)

### Remaining Future Work

- **Medium Priority:** E2E test coverage expansion, visual regression suite
- **Medium Priority:** Mobile PWA (offline queue, touch targets, service worker)
- **Low Priority:** Executive KPI dashboard full buildout
- **Low Priority:** ML predictive maintenance model (XGBoost on breakdown history)
