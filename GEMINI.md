## 🏗️ Architecture & Tech Stack

- **Monorepo**: Turborepo + pnpm 9.12.0.
- **Frontend**: Next.js 15+ (App Router), React 19, Tailwind (OKLCH).
- **Backend**: Supabase (PostgreSQL, Auth, RLS), Payload CMS v3.
- **Quality**: Strict TypeScript, Jest, Playwright, DeepEval.

## 🚀 Key Commands

- `pnpm quality`: Full quality gate (lint, type-check, test, format-check).
- `pnpm build`: Build all workspace projects.
- `pnpm test`: Run all unit tests.
- `pnpm test:e2e`: Run Playwright E2E tests.

## 🛠️ Global Development Conventions

### Data Safety & Confirmation

- **Data is Sacred**: All operations must prioritize data integrity and security.
- **Confirmation Required**: For any data-related change, I must halt execution, explain the potential impact on data, and ask for your explicit confirmation before proceeding. This applies to:
  - Database schema migrations (`packages/database`).
  - Data mutation logic (Server Actions, API routes).
  - Changes to authentication or authorization rules (RLS).

### Production Readiness & Recovery

- **Production Readiness**: All changes must pass the full quality gate (`pnpm quality`) and live verification to ensure the system remains deployable at all times.
- **Automated Rollback**: If any change breaks the build, tests, or critical functionality, I must automatically revert the responsible code change and re-evaluate my approach.

### Verification Discipline

- **Tests pass ≠ program working.** Fresh runs are mandatory.
- **Frontend changes require live verification.** Start `pnpm dev`, navigate to the page, and interact with the UI.
- **Evidence before claims.** Never say "it works" without concrete proof (test output, browser check).

### Systematic Debugging

1. **Root Cause**: Reproduce consistently, check diffs, instrument boundaries.
2. **Hypothesis**: Specific and falsifiable. Test one variable at a time.
3. **Defense-in-Depth**: Make bugs structurally impossible. Validate at entry points, logic, and environment layers.
4. **Bail-out**: 3+ failed fixes indicate an architectural problem. Stop and rethink.

### Change Discipline

- **Lineage Test**: Every changed line must trace to a specific requirement.
- **Orphan Cleanup**: Remove imports/vars/functions your changes made unused.
- **Never Invent Values**: Authoritatively confirm paths, env vars, and IDs before using them.
