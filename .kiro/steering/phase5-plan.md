# Phase 5: Multi-Agent Swarm & Advanced Autonomy

**Target: ~100% Claude Code parity → True Superiority**

This phase is the final frontier — moving beyond replication into genuine innovation across three principles: **Zero-Trust Observability**, **Radical Context Efficiency**, and **Multi-Model Cognitive Diversity**.

---

## Step 5.1: Federated Multi-Model Router

Stop relying on a single LLM. Build a router that matches tasks to optimal models.

- **Specialized model routing**: UI generation → GPT, code refactoring → Claude, validation → local Qwen
- **Automatic fallback**: If primary model fails/rate-limited, cascade to next best
- **Cost-aware scheduling**: Route simple tasks to cheap models, complex tasks to powerful ones
- **Implementation**: `.kiro/router/` with provider registry, cost tracking, and circuit breaker per model

**Key repos**: `allenai/SERA` (fine-tunable local agent), `moonshotai/Kimi-K2.6` (300-agent parallel swarm)

---

## Step 5.2: "Zero-Trust" Observability & Compliance Layer

Beyond logs — a compliance layer that cryptographically guarantees every action.

- **Non-repudiable audit trails**: Blockchain-style SHA-256 hashed ledger of every tool call and state change — enterprise-grade receipts
- **Declarative sandboxing**: Hard-enforcement filesystem/network proxy. Agent proposes changes, security layer validates against policies before execution. Blocks edits to protected resources even if model prompts instruct otherwise.
- **Implementation**: Extend existing 7-layer safety + guardrails with `crypto.createHash` chain linking every audit entry. Add eBPF-style filesystem watcher for out-of-band enforcement.

---

## Step 5.3: Radical Context Efficiency Engine

Break the link between context window size and agent coherence.

- **Plotter & Doer architecture**: Long-lived "Plotter" maintains strategy/memory; short-lived stateless "Doer" agents execute tactical steps with compact context
- **Polycode's "Canon"**: Append-only history store outside model context. Prompt becomes a structural query against the canon, not a dump of all history
- **5-stage progressive compaction** (from Phase 4) now runs by default on every tool step
- **Implementation**: `.kiro/canon/` — append-only JSONL store with query interface. Plotter at `.kiro/plotter/` — maintains session plan. Doers spawned via executor.

**Key repos**: `opendev-to/opendev` (Rust Plotter & Doer), `polylogicai/polycode` (Canon architecture)

---

## Step 5.4: Multi-Agent Quality Enforcement

Enforce structured correctness workflows where agents specialize.

- **Spec → Test → Implement → QA → Verify pipeline**: One agent writes spec, another writes tests from spec, implementation agent makes tests pass, QA agent reviews, verification agent signs off
- **Specialized profiles**: Code Reviewer, Test Generator, Security Auditor — each with distinct system prompts and tool permissions
- **Implementation**: Extend evaluator-optimizer (Phase 3d) into a 5-stage pipeline. Each stage gets its own subagent with scoped tool access.

**Key repos**: `JoshFT/correctless` (multi-agent correctness workflow), `Geoffe-Ga/specinit` (specialized agent profiles)

---

## Step 5.5: Native Browser & Visual Testing

Let agents interact with live UIs directly.

- **Headless browser integration**: Screenshot, inspect DOM, run visual regression tests
- **Autonomous layout debugging**: Agent views rendered page to fix CSS/UI bugs without human intervention
- **Implementation**: Wire Playwright MCP (already in `.mcp.json`) into a dedicated visual-test tool. Add screenshot diffing via pixelmatch.

---

## Step 5.6: Speculative & Predictive Operations

Anticipate user needs before they're expressed.

- **Pre-fetch likely files**: Based on conversation context and git history, pre-load files the agent will likely edit
- **Pre-generate test stubs**: When user mentions a function, auto-generate empty test files
- **Predict git merge/rebase outcomes**: Simulate rebase before execution to warn of conflicts
- **Implementation**: `.kiro/speculative/` — predictive model using TF-IDF vector similarity against session history and git log patterns

---

## Step 5.7: Next-Gen Code Search

Replace basic grep with specialized code embeddings.

- **Integrate `potion-code-16M`**: Fast static code embedding model for retrieval
- **Integrate `F2LLM-v2`**: 40+ programming languages, 280+ natural languages
- **Multi-modal search**: Combine keyword (grep), semantic (vector), and structural (AST) search
- **Implementation**: Extend vector memory (Phase 3a) with pluggable embedding backends. Add AST parser for structural queries.

---

## Step 5.8: Scaled Parallel Agent Swarm

Unlock truly parallel multi-agent coordination.

- **`maxParallelAgents`** hard limit with WAL (Write-Ahead Logging) mode to avoid DB lock contention
- **Swarm orchestration**: Teams of specialized agents working on subtasks in parallel
- **Conflict-aware merging**: Detect and resolve competing edits from parallel agents
- **Implementation**: Extend orchestrator (Phase 3b) with swarm mode. Add WAL mode to all SQLite-backed stores.

**Key repos**: `moonshotai/Kimi-K2.6` (reference for 300-agent parallel coordination)

---

## Step 5.9: Agent Self-Improvement Loop

Agents that learn from past sessions and evolve strategies.

- **Error pattern mining**: Analyze past failures in audit log, extract common patterns, update guardrails automatically
- **Prompt optimization**: Track which prompts yield best results, auto-tune system prompts per task type
- **Strategy evolution**: If a task approach fails, the Plotter records the failure and avoids that approach next time
- **Implementation**: `.kiro/learning/` — periodic background job that mines audit/trace/guardrails logs and produces improvement patches

---

## Step 5.10: Production Readiness Hardening

Final deployment preparation.

- **Full Docker Compose deployment**: n8n + Langfuse + Qdrant + Prometheus + Grafana + Kiro
- **Horizontal scaling**: Redis-backed queue with multiple worker processes
- **Health dashboard**: Grafana dashboards for all observability signals
- **SLA monitoring**: Uptime, latency P99, error budget tracking
- **Disaster recovery**: Automated backup of LTM store, audit logs, and n8n workflows
